# Object-Detection-based-on-Mask-RCNN-and-COCO-dataset
In this notebook, we trained a model based on Matterport (Mask RCNN) to detect and segment an object. This Transfer learning is based on COCO dataset. We created our own dataset and annotate the object with Via annotator makesense. We chose Lion as a new object that is not in COCO dataset.
The code implemented by pysource. and we used Google colab as our IDE.
(Integrated development environment).
# Installization
1. Upload "Mask_RCNN_Lion.ipynb" in google colab.
2. Upload "Lion" zip folder for dataset in files.
3. Upload "Lion" Json file for Annotations in files.
4. Run the Notebook.
